KVM welcomes students\n        with high motivation and concern for ecology, to join as an internee to\n        practice natural farming as trainees working with Organic Farmers and to\n        learn organic farming.

They are soil scientists,\n        entomologist, biologists, and ecologists, seed keepers - plant breeders\n        and persons saturated with traditional wisdom and compassion for nature\n        at one time. Internees will get personalized supervision from these\n        farmers.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Interns will get a wide range exposure of different variants of natural\n        / organic farming technologies and its different social dimension. These\n        interns will allocate different tasks and venture in organic farms with\n        an expectation that they will do assigned work with high integrity and\n        sincerity. They may work alone or in a team of interns or volunteers, or\n        side-by-side with community members. They can share and exchange\n        information and their experiences about natural farming, needs and\n        benefits of natural farming, health risks of over-usage of chemical\n        fertilizers and insecticide sprays.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Experiences of Our Internees\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            <Link to=\"/internship/anna\">Anna Helfers, from Germany</Link>\n          </li>\n          <li>Trent Brown, from University of Wollongong, Australia</li>\n          <li>Swarup Datta, PhD, Delhi School of Economics, New Delhi</li>\n        </ul>\n      </p>\n    </Card>\n  </PageLayout>\n);\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/maya-05af89d6955af44dbfb83126cd762050.jpg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
