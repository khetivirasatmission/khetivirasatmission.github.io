About farming, about life, about family, my mind is very easy now and I can enjoy life. Natural farming is not profit-oriented.

We get better growth, more flowering, and everything. Quality of production has vastly increased. Each time we use these sprays we learn on which crop do they work. When we see it work we can determine which spray works on which crop. We share these practical experiences among farmers through KVM and we develop a network.

I kept the seed. Conventionally, a good yield of mustard is 6 quintal per acre. We calculated the potential yield for this crop could be above 20 quintals.

Instead, I use only 2 kilo of Jantar per acre and allow some of the weeds that I want to stay in the field. This fixes nitrogen, maintains soil pH, it reduces alkalinity by absorbing the salts.
