As the largest recipient of Green\n        Revolution in the country, the state of Punjab is today witnessing its\n        biggest food, farm, health, ecological and civilizational crisis than\n        ever before. This is ironic for a state known as the land of five rivers\n        and one where life was synonymous with prosperity and abundance.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Even though Punjab holds only 2.5% area of agricultural land in the\n        country it consumes 18% pesticides used in the country. The people of\n        the state are facing multiple environmental toxicity of pesticides and\n        other agro-chemicals, heavy metals and environmental pollution caused by\n        ecologically unsustainable agricultural practices. The water sources are\n        either polluted or destroyed or dried-up.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        KVM feels that there is an urgent need to pro-actively work towards\n        restoring faith in Punjab's traditional farming system through a\n        reconnect with nature and natural systems. At the same time there is a\n        crucial requirement to work actively towards a consistent engagement\n        with a policy discourse where Punjab's model and its impacts needs to be\n        exposed and learnt from. Central to KVM's work is also to bring back\n        women in the decision making sphere, a heritage that current day Punjab\n        has lost out on.\n      </p>\n    </Card>\n    <Card title=\"Four R's Approach\" bordered={false}>\n      <p>\n        In order to work towards its goal, KVM has adopted an approach to its\n        activities known as Four 'R's\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        (a) Restore a network of farmers, scientists, consumers, media on\n        reclaiming Punjab's agriculture from the hands of hybridization and\n        modern agriculture biotechnology\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        (b) Revive most creative and spiritual practices like Nanak Kheti, Guru\n        Nanak's teachings and showcase that it can work in today's fast growing\n        times too.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        (c) Recreate an ownership and connection with traditional foods (Bebe Di\n        Rasoi)-what we demand to eat, will grow in our fields.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        (d) Resurrect a non-commodified, biodiversity agenda which is long\n        forgotten in Punjab's farming policy and political frame.\n      </p>\n    </Card>\n    <Card title=\"How you can contribute?\" bordered={false}>\n      <p>\n        KVM is a large network of people from all walks of life who have come\n        together to work for a better Punjab.
