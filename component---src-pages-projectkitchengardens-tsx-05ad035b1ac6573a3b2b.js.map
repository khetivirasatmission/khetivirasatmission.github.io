Third - Nutritional security was lost, as fruits, vegetables\n        and medicinal plants were either out of the farming scenario or fed with\n        cocktails of pesticides. Fourth - The food was devoid of compassion and\n        life-force energy. To address these issues, we had started working with\n        women to establish kitchen gardens in villages.{\" \"}\n      </p>\n    </Card>\n\n    <Card title=\"Our Project\" bordered={false}>\n      <p>\n        With the support of Association for India's Development (AID), we\n        started the ‘Women Action for Organic Farming and Rural Livelihood’ in\n        2011. Under this umbrella, we are training women to establish Organic\n        Kitchen Gardens (inclusive of vegetables, fruits, medicinal plants and\n        mushroom cultivation) in their backyards.

So, native seeds, collected from various states and\n        adapted into the environment of Punjab, were distributed to the\n        gardeners. KVM groomed them to conserve these seeds every year for next\n        sowing seasons. Slowly, the gardeners became seed savers; and currently\n        we have <strong>110 family seed banks</strong> maintained by these\n        women. KVM distributes <strong>‘seed kits’</strong> to the newcomers\n        comprising of seeds of 15 - 20 seasonal vegetables.\n      </p>\n\n      <h4>Mushroom Cultivation</h4>\n      <p>\n        To add-on to their livelihood, we organise Mushroom Cultivation\n        workshops for our gardeners.

Their classroom was a one-acre rented plot in Chaina\n        village of Faridkot district. These young seed savers were trained to\n        manage the farm; grow organic and indigenous vegetables; conserve the\n        seeds, preserve them with traditional practices and markete them in\n        various public events, under the auspices of KVM. These seeds were sold\n        as ‘seed kits’ yielding an earning of Rs. 80,000; which was distributed\n        among the group itself.\n      </p>\n    </Card>\n\n    <Card title=\"The Garden Tales\"
