How could such a drastic shift come in our health within a generation?” He found the problem and the solution in farming. “We are what we eat. Nobody disputes that our ancestors had more nutritious food than us. They had lesser stress triggers than us because of the simple life they led. I wanted better health for my family but was not sure on how to achieve that,” he says. Kamaljeet started searching online and came across the website of Kheti Virasat Mission. He called up KVM’s executive president Umendra Dutt who asked him to attend a workshop being organised in a few days.
