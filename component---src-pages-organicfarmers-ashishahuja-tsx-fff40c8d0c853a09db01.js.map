But since I\n        was new, and it was easier to do chemical, I decided to start with\n        chemical. But the germ was here. When I realized that my father was\n        diagnosed with cancer, it increased my determination to start. Earlier,\n        I noticed that organic inputs were more expensive. Then, I met Vinod\n        Jyani and after that I attended a workshop with Subash Palekar. I felt a\n        boost because, he was preaching simple techniques and his enthusiasm got\n        transmitted very easily. He made us believe that it could be done\n        easily. I seriously started in early 2006. Even though I did not meet\n        the success I was expecting, I still consider it sufficiently successful\n        not to pull out of it. I know that my unsatisfactory results are due to\n        my lack of rigor in applying the techniques the way they were taught. I\n        started with 30 acres and now I do 25 acres. For the first 2 years, I\n        was following Subash Palekar. Then, I started applying a mix of methods.\n      </p>\n      <p> </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>\n          Which are the difficulties that you faced in the initial stage and\n          which problem are you still facing now?\n        </strong>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        {\" \"}\n        Productivity is a problem, because I don’t want to sell it at a premium.\n        The quantity of mulching material is not available to practice it\n        properly on my fields. And the second problem is weeding. It creates a\n        management problem and a problem of monitoring. If, it is done at the\n        right time, then it is ok. But because of external issues, I am not\n        spending enough time on the farm. This is my biggest problem. Moreover,\n        I don’t produce jaggery or organic cow urine. I don’t have purely\n        organic diet for my cattle.\n      </p>\n      <p> </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>\n          What do you think of your responsibilities are as a farmer?\n        </strong>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        {\" \"}\n        My primary responsibility is to provide safe and healthy food to myself\n        and my family, and to my people (farm workers). It is also important to\n        earn money so that I can live comfortably. The corollary is to sell as\n        local as possible and to make my soil as fertile as it is possible in\n        this area. The organic content will never reach 3%, as it is advised to\n        the organic farmer, because the weather won’t allow it. Right now, it is\n        0.3 %.

People can come and realize that staying on the\n        farm is meaningful. There should be a lot of exchange in knowledge. The\n        only thing you can do is set an example. But the people who will be\n        inspired are most likely urban people. They are probably also the ones\n        who will be most successful because they are more driven.

If I was a bachelor, I wouldn’t have realized\n        that we have to have women involved, so that you can stay on your farm.\n        Even if it is not in farm production, they should be involved in\n        something that has some connection with agriculture. But, they have\n        maybe a greater role in marketing. Women were never involved in the\n        management. I would like to involve my family so that I can get\n        meaningful inputs from which we could create things, so that we can do\n        value addition (Instead of selling raw cotton, selling processed\n        products.)\n      </p>\n      <p> </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>\n          How do you deal with the social pressure to adopt consumerist’s\n          behaviors (maximizing your leisure time, minimizing you labor time,\n          that is to say, spending less time on your work and more time on\n          entertainment )?\n        </strong>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        It’s not so true in the Indian context.

In organic\n        farming, they don’t provide much guidance; they teach mostly how to use\n        chemical, because there are vested interests. In the procurement\n        policies, environmental questions are left out of the equation. The\n        system is full of self-contradiction. So, more sincerity is the major\n        requirement.
