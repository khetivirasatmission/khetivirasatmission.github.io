We get better growth, more flowering, and everything. Quality of production has vastly increased. Each time we use these sprays we learn on which crop do they work. When we see it work we can determine which spray works on which crop. We share these practical experiences among farmers through KVM and we develop a network. Green manuring, mulching and enzyme sprays have been very effective to develop humus. For innovations, I was the first to try paddy extract and was able to get good results.

Instead, I use only 2 kilo of Jantar per acre and allow some of the weeds that I want to stay in the field. This fixes nitrogen, maintains soil pH, it reduces alkalinity by absorbing the salts.
