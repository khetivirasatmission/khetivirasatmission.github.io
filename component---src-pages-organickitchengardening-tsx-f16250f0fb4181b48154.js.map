In the last few years, hundreds of farmers have adopted\n        natural farming. KVM undertakes a variety of activities to educate,\n        sensitize, & train farmers for organic farming through Workshops,\n        Seminars, Farmer Field Schools and Participatory Resource Appraisals.\n      </p>\n    </Card>\n    <Card title=\"Seeds Conservation\" bordered={false}>\n      <p>\n        KVM seeks to revive our local traditional seed varieties and actively\n        promotes their production. KVM motivates farmers to save their own seeds\n        and then use those seeds in farming practices. As a result, many farmers\n        are now saving their own seeds. For this, KVM has provided them a great\n        deal of indigenous seeds from different states of the country like\n        Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh etc., and\n        this holy work is ongoing.\n      </p>\n    </Card>\n    <Card title=\"Chemical-free Kitchen Gardening\" bordered={false}>\n      <p>\n        Women Action for Ecology, (WAE) a branch of KVM, encourages women to\n        start growing vegetables in their kitchen gardens. \"Feed your children\n        with poison free safe food\" is the slogan of this campaign. It begins\n        with making kitchens poison-free: free from that food which is grown\n        with pesticides and other agro-chemicals. Through this campaign, women\n        are motivated to start small kitchen gardens to grow seasonal vegetables\n        organically. This initiative is also ensuring more diverse and safe food\n        for the new generation of Punjab. From its beginnings in two villages,\n        Chaina and Bhotna, this campaign is now slowly spreading to nine more\n        villages. A key dimension of this campaign is the conservation of native\n        diversity of vegetable seeds. In the era of IPRs (private patents on\n        seeds) it is important to have our own seeds in our own hands.\n      </p>\n    </Card>\n    <Card title=\"Inter-cropping System\" bordered={false}>\n      <p>\n        KVM works to enhance the biodiversity in the fields. For this it\n        encourages the farmers to adopt an intercropping crop system. This\n        increases the soil fertility and diversity of food. Intercropping offers\n        farmers the opportunity to engage nature's principle of diversity on\n        their farms.\n      </p>\n    </Card>\n\n    <Card title=\"Training workshops for farmers\" bordered={false}>\n      <p>\n        KVM organizes regular workshops and training on natural farming\n        practices.

For this purpose, more than 4,000 village level awareness\n        meetings and farmer field workshop were organized across the state. More\n        than 15,000 farmers had participated in these workshops and meetings. At\n        present, more than 2,500 farmers are practicing natural farming in\n        association with KVM. These farmers have adopted various natural methods\n        of soil nutrition management, pest management, crop management and water\n        management. The Natural Farming experts associated with KVM also update\n        beginner Natural Farmers with the latest technological information and\n        new farming practices.\n      </p>\n    </Card>\n\n    <Card title=\"Revival of Food heritage\" bordered={false}>\n      <p>\n        KVM also works to revive food heritage in the Malwa region of Punjab.\n        For this, it is working to promote the use of millets like Bajra, Jowar,\n        Makki, as they are very nutritious and part of our traditional food\n        habits. KVM organizes “Bebe Di Rasoi”, a traditional food based festival\n        to promote millet based food habits every year.\n      </p>\n    </Card>\n\n    <Card\n      title=\"Establishing a pool of local resource persons all around the state\"\n      bordered={false}\n    >\n      <p>\n        This is another big achievement of KVM-- that we have successfully\n        established so many of common people/farmers as local resource persons\n        on different environmental, agricultural and health issues.\n      </p>\n    </Card>\n\n    <Card title=\"Awareness about GM crops\" bordered={false}>\n      <p>\n        KVM is also generating awareness about the negative effects of GM crops\n        on soil, environment as well as on health.
