Under this umbrella, we are training women to establish Organic\n          Kitchen Gardens (inclusive of vegetables, fruits, medicinal plants and\n          mushroom cultivation) in their backyards. Started from 4 villages in\n          2011, it has now spread across <strong>60 villages</strong> with{\" \"}\n          <strong>6,000 women</strong> involved.{\" \"}\n        </p>\n      </Card>\n\n      <Card title=\"Our Initiatives\" bordered={false}>\n        <h4>Kitchen Gardens</h4>\n        <p>\n          KVM delivers trainings which include designing the garden; making\n          natural growth promotors; pest management; seed conservation & much\n          more.

So, native seeds, collected from various\n          states and adapted into the environment of Punjab, were distributed to\n          the gardeners. KVM groomed them to conserve these seeds every year for\n          next sowing seasons. Slowly, the gardeners became seed savers; and\n          currently we have <strong>110 family seed banks</strong> maintained by\n          these women. KVM distributes <strong>‘seed kits’</strong> to the\n          newcomers comprising of seeds of 15 - 20 seasonal vegetables.\n        </p>\n\n        <h4>Mushroom Cultivation</h4>\n        <p>\n          To add-on to their livelihood, we organise Mushroom Cultivation\n          workshops for our gardeners.
