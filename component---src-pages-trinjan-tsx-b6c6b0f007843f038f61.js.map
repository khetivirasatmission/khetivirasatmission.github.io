To revive the great knowledge\n          of textile and handicrafts that women had, TRINJAN started in 4\n          villages in 2017. The self-reliance of cloth, aka 'Vastra\n          Swavlambham’, which was once a part and parcel of our culture, was\n          lost long ago. Most of the spinners and weavers were women. They were\n          also actively involved in agriculture and dairy activities. In the\n          course of industrialisation and modernization, most of them lost their\n          patience and interest amid the flood of easily accessible ready-made\n          garments and limited themselves to household chores. The charkhas were\n          abandoned and the weavers were out of practice. KVM identified these\n          women artisans, most of them from poor financial backgrounds, and\n          encouraged them to restart their work professionally, with KVM.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Under the umbrella of TRINJAN, we also organise festive gatherings\n          known as Trinjan Melas, exhibitions with live demonstrations,\n          traditional food festivals and cultural programmes.\n        </p>\n      </Card>\n\n      {/* <Row>\n      <Col xs={24}>\n        <ExpandableImage name=\"trinjan\" image={start} />\n      </Col>\n    </Row> */}\n\n      <Card title=\"Value chain\" bordered={false}>\n        <p>\n          Organic indigenous Cotton grown by the farmers, is procured by KVM at\n          premium prices, hand spun, naturally dyed and hand woven by the rural\n          artisans.

village in Muktsar district. With her\n            academic background in fashion, she developed a quick passion for\n            natural dyeing. We trained her into using all-natural plant\n            materials to make dyes for the thread, including marigold flowers,\n            carrots, onion skin, babul (gum arabic) bark, pomegranate skin,\n            eucalyptus bark and much more. She attended regular trainings. Thus,\n            not just her skills developed but also her wisdom. She understood\n            that artificial dyes cause skin irritations and infections; thus\n            switching to natural dyes is the need of the hour. TRINJAN has also\n            given this young adult, a source of earning bread and butter,\n            working from home. As people started acknowledging her work through\n            KVM, her confidence is boosted by leaps and bounds. She says, “I\n            will be glad to train others and share this art I have learnt\n            through KVM. I will, happily, carry on with this work as it gives me\n            deep creative satisfaction.” Rimpy represents the youth, which if\n            provided with appropriate guidance and skills, can bring a change in\n            the outlook of youngsters.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </Col>\n    </Row>\n\n    <Row gutter={18}>\n      <Col xs={24} md={12} lg={6}>\n        <div id=\"gagandeepkaur\">\n          <Profile\n            name=\"Gagandeep Kaur (26)\"\n            designation=\"Embroider and Tailor\"\n            image={t2}\n          />\n        </div>\n      </Col>\n      <Col xs={24} md={12} lg={18}>\n        <div style={storyStyle}>\n          <p>\n            A high school pass out, Gagandeep Kaur, lives in the Kotli village\n            in district Muktsar.

She says, “I continued\n            both of these skills as a past time ever since I had learnt them.

Now I am able to provide financial backing to my family,\n            too.” Being more delicate, working with natural material was little\n            challenging in the beginning.

The impacts of both having\n            an organic kitchen garden and continuing to incorporate her\n            traditional basket weaving into her daily life are clear for Manjit.\n            They are holistically beneficial to Manjit herself as well as her\n            family and the broader community and planet.\n          </p>\n        </div> */}\n      {/* </Col> */}\n\n      {/* <Col xs={24} md={12} lg={12}>\n        \n\n        <div>\n          <Profile name=\"Gurcharan Kaur\" image={t8} />\n          <p>\n            Gurcharan Kaur lives in Kotli, Muktsar and is 60 years old. She\n            lives alone and has no formal education. When she was 15 years old,\n            her older sister taught her how to weave and she has been weaving\n            ever since. She now can complete one full piece in about two weeks\n            or so, working on them for about 4 hours each day. Gurcharan also\n            says that she feels better when she is doing it. When she stops, she\n            says that her body also stops and doesn’t feel as well. She\n            continues advocating that doing work by hand is best. Indirectly,\n            this is what this case study highlights. It is not just about the\n            weaving being a source of income and improved economic stability,\n            but that the work that is being done by hand is also maintaining a\n            simplicity to life that is often overlooked.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div>\n          <Profile name=\"Sukhjit Kaur\" image={t10} />\n          <p>\n            Sukhjit Kaur is 60 years old and lives in Kotli, Muktsar. She has no\n            formal education. She began weaving when she was 20 years old,\n            learning from her mother, and has been doing it ever since. She says\n            that she does it to make things that she needs in her house and that\n            it is also a helpful income source – making money by doing weaving\n            for other people as well. It takes her about 20 days to make one\n            weaving and she feels that it is helpful to her household income and\n            that she is satisfied with the money that she makes. She also feels\n            that it connects her to her family, from the past and into the\n            future. Now, her daughter-in-law has shown interest in learning to\n            weave. Additionally, she says, that it connects her to her culture.\n            In the past, she says, everyone did work by hand but now no one\n            wants to do this work. She thinks that if we want to connect the\n            younger generation to it, we need to be doing it and teaching them\n            while we are doing it. This case shows the passion that can be\n            evoked when someone not only conscientiously benefits from their\n            work (i.e. economically) but enjoys it in a way that they look\n            forward to time spent in the process itself.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div>\n          <Profile name=\"Mahinder Kaur\" image={t11} />\n          <p>\n            Mahinder Kaur is 60 years old and has 9 members in her family. Her\n            aunt taught her to weave when she was 15 years old and she has been\n            doing it ever since. She says that in the past, everyone did work\n            like this and that if younger generations are going to continue, the\n            work needs to be done in front of them, so they can see it. Mahinder\n            believes that doing work by hand is good and it makes her happy. She\n            can make 200 /- per day by this doing this work. As compared to the\n            past, she does less work now, because she is older. Now she works an\n            hour or two in a day. But it continues to keep her connected to her\n            culture and because of it, her community sees her in a positive\n            light. She says that because she started doing this so many years\n            ago, everyone knows her as a weaver.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div>\n          <Profile name=\"Gurjit Kaur\" image={t12} />\n          <p>\n            Gurjit Kaur is 40 years old, lives in village Kotli, Muktsar. She\n            says that in the past, everyone did work like weaving but now, no\n            one is interested. But Gurjit believes that doing work by hand is\n            good. She says that now that the machines have come, they have taken\n            away the importance of handwork. She also is able to help pay for\n            her house expenses from the money that she earns from weaving.\n            Weaving also makes her feel like there is more of a purpose in her\n            life because many people in her village know her as a weaver and\n            they like her work. Still, there are times when people do not pay\n            her properly and so she appreciates that KVM gives her work, paying\n            her well and on time. She is part of a family of craftswomen who\n            weave and embroider, and they continue an intergenerational\n            connection to this cultural work while also doing it together.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </Col> */}\n      {/* </Row> */}\n    </PageLayout>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Page;\n\nexport const Head: HeadFC = () => <SEO title=\"Trinjan\" />;\n"],"names":["storyStyle","paddingTop","Image","_ref","name","image","___EmotionJSX","className","alt","width","src","LinkedImage","_ref2","url","href","target","StoryList","_ref3","list","data","setData","useState","_Row","gutter","type","map","item","Story","key","designation","story","expanded","onClick","moveTop","currentList","temp","_toConsumableArray","index","findIndex","push","apply","splice","obj","_ref4","im","f","region","file","t0","React","_Col","xs","md","lg","_Card","bordered","bodyStyle","padding","_Button","size","style","dangerouslySetInnerHTML","__html","defaultProps","props","value","formatter","precision","decimalSeparator","groupSeparator","prefixCls","valueNode","val","String","cells","match","negative","int","decimal","replace","padEnd","slice","genStatisticStyle","token","componentCls","marginXXS","colorTextDescription","titleFontSize","colorTextHeading","contentFontSize","fontFamily","Object","assign","marginBottom","color","fontSize","display","direction","marginInlineEnd","marginInlineStart","statisticToken","fontSizeHeading3","__rest","s","e","t","p","prototype","hasOwnProperty","call","indexOf","getOwnPropertySymbols","i","length","propertyIsEnumerable","customizePrefixCls","rootClassName","valueStyle","title","valueRender","prefix","suffix","loading","onMouseEnter","onMouseLeave","rest","getPrefixCls","statistic","wrapCSSVar","hashId","cssVarCls","cls","restProps","pickAttrs","aria","paragraph","timeUnits","formatCountdown","config","format","Date","getTime","current","now","duration","leftDuration","escapeRegex","keepList","str","templateText","replacedText","reduce","unit","includes","Math","floor","RegExp","len","toString","padStart","formatTimeStr","max","REFRESH_INTERVAL","Countdown","onChange","onFinish","forceUpdate","useForceUpdate","countdown","syncTimer","timestamp","setInterval","clearInterval","node","undefined","formatValue","Donate","Link","to","float","columns","dataIndex","intervention","artisans","t1","t2","t5","t7","t3","Page","PageLayout","DonateButton","border","height","allow","_Table","rowClassName","_","dataSource","pagination","sm","_Statistic","Head","SEO"],"sourceRoot":""}
