Green\n        Revolution and industrialization has brought economic prosperity but it\n        had seriously destructive effects upon the ecology and people’s health.\n        It is the need of the hour to inspire the society to switch over to\n        natural living (food forests, natural building and natural lifestyle)\n        practices. The situation is alarming and the signs are ominous. Given\n        the present circumstances, those that are in-tune with nature are the\n        only alternatives.\n      </p>\n    </Card>\n\n    <Card title=\"Work at grassroot level\" bordered={false}>\n      <p>\n        Kheti Virasat Mission is committed to protecting farmers’ right to land,\n        income security, good livelihood &amp; agriculture sovereignty as well\n        as protecting consumers’ right to safe and healthy food. KVM recognizes\n        that in order to achieve these goals, we must put the health of the\n        ecosystem . KVM is working at the grassroots with decentralized\n        participatory methods covering the vast arenas of sustainable\n        agriculture, conservation of ecology and natural resources,\n        environmental health, cultural aspect of ecology and other issues\n        related to globalization, livelihood, environmental and social justice.\n        By involving the very first stakeholders-- the farmers, especially the\n        most marginalized-- KVM had undertaken various activities to enhance\n        their capacities, enabling them to undertake the endeavor of sustainable\n        development and sustainable use of natural resources. KVM has a dream to\n        make farmers, especially the small and marginal farmers, debt-free and\n        living within a non-exploitative system; self-reliant while nurturing\n        their genetic resources and conserving their knowledge system.\n      </p>\n    </Card>\n\n    {/* <h2>Core Team</h2>\n    <Row gutter={18}>\n      <Col span={8}>\n        <Card className=\"card-team\" bordered={false} bodyStyle={{ padding: 0 }}>\n          <div className=\"custom-image\">\n            <img alt=\"Shri Umendra Dutt\" width=\"100%\" src={t1} />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"custom-card\">\n            <h3>Shri Umendra Dutt</h3>\n            <p>Executive Director</p>\n          </div>\n        </Card>\n      </Col>\n      <Col span={8}>\n        <Card className=\"card-team\" bordered={false} bodyStyle={{ padding: 0 }}>\n          <div className=\"custom-image\">\n            <img alt=\"Shri Ajay Tripathi\" width=\"100%\" src={t2} />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"custom-card\">\n            <h3>Shri Ajay Tripathi</h3>\n            <p>\n              Director of Marketing, Skill Development & Human Resource\n              Development\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </Card>\n      </Col>\n      <Col span={8}>\n        <Card className=\"card-team\" bordered={false} bodyStyle={{ padding: 0 }}>\n          <div className=\"custom-image\">\n            <img alt=\"Dr Amar Singh Azad\" width=\"100%\" src={t3} />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"custom-card\">\n            <h3>Dr Amar Singh Azad</h3>\n            <p>Director of Environmental Health Action & Research</p>\n          </div>\n        </Card>\n      </Col>\n    </Row> */}\n  </PageLayout>\n);\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
