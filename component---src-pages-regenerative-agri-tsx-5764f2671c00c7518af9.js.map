Whatever comes\n            out of farm or soil maximum should go back to it by recycling and\n            Composting of Crop residue and Biomass for making the manure and\n            strengthening the soil health. Regenerative Agriculture stands for\n            regeneration of Soil Health therefore No crop residue burning is the\n            foremost principle to adhere by each of Organic Farmer. KVM promotes\n            using this Biomass and Crop residue as mulching, composting and\n            preparing manure, animal fodder and incorporation in soil. KVM also\n            promotes other ecological practices to Stop Crop Residue Burning.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            KVM promotes the unique concept of ‘Adopt a Family Organic Farmer\n            for Health and Nutrition’. It is always better to have a Family\n            Farmer for Safe and Nutritious local food rather than visiting a\n            doctor for medication.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Biodiversity is the master-key of Organic Farming and Biodiversity\n            comes with intercropping and multi-cropping. So KVM endorses an\n            immense crop-diversity system. This diversity built an eco- friendly\n            system that hosts and feed Pollinators, Birds, Microorganisms and\n            other living creatures.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Integrations of herbs, shrubs, creepers, climbers and various\n            medicinal plants to the farm. Having an orchard of fruits and\n            traditional trees and having border crops for the protection of\n            delicate crops and vegetables.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            KVM encourages minimal mechanization to save soil from compaction\n            with heavy farm machinery. No big tractors rather using small\n            implements.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            KVM is committed to Lessor Food Miles approach.

This model has changed the farm\n            landscape of Punjab with a ruthless Mono-cropping, loss of\n            biodiversity, decrease in the water table. Millets- Which formed a\n            major part of Punjab’s diet once, are now replaced with Wheat and\n            Rice. Kheti Virasat Mission has been systematically trying to revive\n            this heritage grain for the past few years. We have recognized that\n            this revival not only brings back nutritional security to the\n            consumers but also addresses the issues of declining water table,\n            loss of biodiversity, soil health and rural unemployment. Kheti\n            Virasat Mission has taken up the challenge of building a value chain\n            of organically grown Millets from Farm to plate.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            KVM has a clear vision of correlation of Farming with Food and Food\n            with Health and Nutrition. We can institute a model of Regenerative\n            Agriculture only if we establish this Triangle of Life based upon\n            Farming, Food and Health & Nutrition.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Women are the backbone of Farming and whole Civilizational Discourse\n            as they can look after the Family, Society and Nation as nobody else\n            can. In the last few decades highly mechanised and chemical\n            intensive agriculture has eroded the scope of any involvement and\n            role of women in the farming. Organic farming brought back a scope\n            for women in farming with different roles.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Native Seeds are vital to our farmers. We believe that seeds must be\n            owned by the farmers themselves and not by the big corporations.\n            Recognizing this ‘Seed Sovereignty’, we have trained hundreds of\n            farmers in seed conservation. Family seed banks have also been\n            created. We have collected seeds from various parts of India and\n            have multiplied them for further distribution.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Livestock is indispensable and one of the most essential part of\n            Organic Farming. Livestock provides base material for home-made\n            Bio-Pesticides and Bio-fertilizer as cow dung and cow urine can be\n            used as fertilizers.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            KVM also promotes the Organic Cotton as the part of its regenerative\n            agriculture initiative. As cotton is most ecological crop if we wish\n            to grow it organically. It required lowest water and no fertilizer.\n            Cotton has also revived livelihoods for traditional spinners and\n            weavers and saved their traditional knowledge system and skills with\n            most Eco-friendly Clothing.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </Card>\n    </PageLayout>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Page;\n\nexport const Head: HeadFC = () => <SEO title=\"Regenerative Agriculture\" />;\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/of1-d96a9abe3ec21d415318bd2d7bc6a337.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/okg1-3f12ed3f58b0c66684456b5557639202.jpg\";"],"names":["Image","_ref","name","image","___EmotionJSX","className","alt","width","src","LinkedImage","_ref3","url","href","target","_ref4","im","f","designation","region","file","t0","_Card","bordered","bodyStyle","padding","Page","PageLayout","_Row","gutter","_Col","xs","md","lg","Profile","okg1","of1","title","style","listStyle","Head","SEO"],"sourceRoot":""}
