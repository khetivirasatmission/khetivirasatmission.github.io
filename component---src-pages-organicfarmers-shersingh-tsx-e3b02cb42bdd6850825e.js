They are sold within two and a half hours of his arrival in the city. Sher Singh never believed that going organic will actually spell big profits for him. “A friend advised me to go for it claiming it has great future.

I felt at least this much service I should do to the society by offering healthier food,” he recalls."),(0,g.Y)("p",null,"At first, Sher Singh got very dismal results.

So, they start with small quantities but after experiencing better quality, they stick with it. Many say instead of spending on medicines in future, we would instead buy costlier but better food today,” Sher Singh informs. With the word-of-mouth publicity, his popularity has risen so much that he does not need to go to each and every house to sell the vegetables. “I have around 35-40 families which are regular buyers.

Now the vegetables are also looking as good as vegetables of any other farmer. But I still have to sell them at higher rate as these take more time to grow,” he explains.

People are getting aware about what they are eating and I think it’s a good sign as once city residents start demanding chemical-free food, farmers would be forced to provide them.
