As the largest recipient of Green\n          Revolution in the country, the state of Punjab is today witnessing its\n          biggest food, farm, health, ecological and civilizational crisis than\n          ever before. This is ironic for a state known as the land of five\n          rivers and one where life was synonymous with prosperity and\n          abundance.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Even though Punjab holds only 2.5% area of agricultural land in the\n          country it consumes 18% pesticides used in the country. The people of\n          the state are facing multiple environmental toxicity of pesticides and\n          other agro-chemicals, heavy metals and environmental pollution caused\n          by ecologically unsustainable agricultural practices. The water\n          sources are either polluted or destroyed or dried-up.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          KVM feels that there is an urgent need to pro-actively work towards\n          restoring faith in Punjab's traditional farming system through a\n          reconnect with nature and natural systems. At the same time there is a\n          crucial requirement to work actively towards a consistent engagement\n          with a policy discourse where Punjab's model and its impacts needs to\n          be exposed and learnt from.
