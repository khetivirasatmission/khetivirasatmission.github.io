Then, I met Vinod Jyani and after that I attended a workshop with Subash Palekar. I felt a boost because, he was preaching simple techniques and his enthusiasm got transmitted very easily. He made us believe that it could be done easily. I seriously started in early 2006. Even though I did not meet the success I was expecting, I still consider it sufficiently successful not to pull out of it. I know that my unsatisfactory results are due to my lack of rigor in applying the techniques the way they were taught. I started with 30 acres and now I do 25 acres.
