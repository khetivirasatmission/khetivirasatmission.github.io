The 5 rivers of Punjab used to be very clean, now they are polluted. There is a law which requires no pollution of natural waters, but the same politicians planned our waterways to pollute the sources. The area of Pubjab uses 17 % of the pesticides in India.

In our traditional system, we think that the cows are our mother. In chemical farming there is no place for cows. We are a part of nature, not the owner. In natural farming, we go with nature’s desire. Natural farming is just in a small area right now, they are hard to find. Even farmers here do not have desi cows, they are all worshiping American cows. In India, cow beef is not eaten openly. This is the major problem that hff cows have caused. After 4 or 5 lactations, they are ready for slaughter, but here you cannot slaughter them.
