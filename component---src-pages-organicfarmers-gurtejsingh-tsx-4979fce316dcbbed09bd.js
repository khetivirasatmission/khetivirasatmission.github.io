They have forgotten that this is the only occupation which feeds generations and keeps them physically and mentally sound. We are because of the food we eat and food is there because of the soil. Unless we improve the soil quality, how can we expect a healthy society,” he asks and answers almost immediately: “There’s no better place to start from than home.” Gurtej grows most vegetables, wheat, maize, basmati rice and fodder naturally and now aims to reduce market dependency for fruits. “At least we should have those which grow naturally in Punjab,” he beams."),(0,u.Y)("p",null),(0,u.Y)("p",null,"To those who ask him about the yield he’s getting, Gurtej suggests they look at the balance sheet. “With natural farming, you save anywhere between Rs 6,000-8,000 per acre besides reduction in water use and increased soil health. The food being healthier is a bonus. But it’s not easy to explain this to people who think only in terms of monetary benefits. They are too scared to experiment and lack the courage to go organic,” he informs as a matter of fact. Initially, his mother was also not in favour of taking such drastic steps.
