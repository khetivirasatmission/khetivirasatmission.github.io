But since\n          I was new, and it was easier to do chemical, I decided to start with\n          chemical. But the germ was here. When I realized that my father was\n          diagnosed with cancer, it increased my determination to start.\n          Earlier, I noticed that organic inputs were more expensive. Then, I\n          met Vinod Jyani and after that I attended a workshop with Subash\n          Palekar. I felt a boost because, he was preaching simple techniques\n          and his enthusiasm got transmitted very easily. He made us believe\n          that it could be done easily. I seriously started in early 2006. Even\n          though I did not meet the success I was expecting, I still consider it\n          sufficiently successful not to pull out of it. I know that my\n          unsatisfactory results are due to my lack of rigor in applying the\n          techniques the way they were taught. I started with 30 acres and now I\n          do 25 acres. For the first 2 years, I was following Subash Palekar.\n          Then, I started applying a mix of methods.\n        </p>\n        <p> </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong>\n            Which are the difficulties that you faced in the initial stage and\n            which problem are you still facing now?\n          </strong>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          {\" \"}\n          Productivity is a problem, because I don’t want to sell it at a\n          premium. The quantity of mulching material is not available to\n          practice it properly on my fields. And the second problem is weeding.\n          It creates a management problem and a problem of monitoring. If, it is\n          done at the right time, then it is ok. But because of external issues,\n          I am not spending enough time on the farm. This is my biggest problem.\n          Moreover, I don’t produce jaggery or organic cow urine. I don’t have\n          purely organic diet for my cattle.\n        </p>\n        <p> </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong>\n            What do you think of your responsibilities are as a farmer?\n          </strong>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          {\" \"}\n          My primary responsibility is to provide safe and healthy food to\n          myself and my family, and to my people (farm workers).

The corollary\n          is to sell as local as possible and to make my soil as fertile as it\n          is possible in this area. The organic content will never reach 3%, as\n          it is advised to the organic farmer, because the weather won’t allow\n          it. Right now, it is 0.3 %.

If I was a bachelor, I wouldn’t have realized\n          that we have to have women involved, so that you can stay on your\n          farm. Even if it is not in farm production, they should be involved in\n          something that has some connection with agriculture. But, they have\n          maybe a greater role in marketing.
