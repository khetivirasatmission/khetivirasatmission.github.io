But I had several doubts stopping me from take the plunge. The team from KVM sorted out all of them to my satisfaction,” he says. The experiment started with fodder grass bersem. “I competed with my father who used chemicals to grow the same crop on equal piece of land.

When the income from farming does not see him through, he works as a daily wager on the fields of neighbours. “Nowadays farmers have grown big egos and to satisfy them they claim to have got higher yields than others. But everybody knows the truth. The yields are dwindling as soil is getting infertile due to bad practices. I am satisfied with what I have chosen.
