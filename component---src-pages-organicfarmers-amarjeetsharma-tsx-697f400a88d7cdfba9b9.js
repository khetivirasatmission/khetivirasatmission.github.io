After that, I started applying NF on half an acre of my land. I grew wheat and vegetables along with fodder for the cattle. I got a very good result. Then in October 26th and 27th, I got the opportunity to attend a workshop conducted by Mr. Subash Palekar in Amritsar, at the Pingalwara Foundation. So in April 2007, I converted the totality of my 5 acres of land to NF. I sowed cotton and I got 6 quintal per acre (the average with BT cotton is 8 quintal per acre). I sold it for the normal price. It’s only after that that I started including more and more diversity in the cropping system on my farm. Since 2009, I sell my products to an institution that takes care of handicapped children, I get a premium price for them and the products are much appreciated. I’ve been told that the children are now having a better health and are therefore requiring fewer drugs for their treatment. The production on my farm is obviously also used for the self-consumption of my family."),s.a.createElement("p",null,"In 2007, I also started a Seed Bank to conserve indigenous seeds and become progressively self-sufficient as well as capable of spreading the use of our traditional varieties among other farmers. So far, I am able to grow 60 different types of crop on my 5 acres of land. I am distributing the seeds to friends who are willing to start NF on a piece of their land. In theory, they get the seeds as a loan and they are supposed to return twice the quantity that they received after one year. In actual fact, the farmers never returned any seeds. So far, I gave seeds to more than 200 farmers. The fact that they don’t return the seeds after one year makes me consider the possibility of selling the seeds instead of lending them (but then, the principle of the Seed bank will be lost). Or maybe, selling the seeds will be a strategy just in the initial stage."),s.a.createElement("p",null,"The reason why I switched from Chemical to Natural farming lies primarily in an economical calculation. In chemical farming, almost every year we see the cost of the inputs increasing (either because they are more expensive, or because we need to use them in larger quantity, or very often because of a combination of these two factors). So in these conditions, the farmer has to witness the ineluctable decrease of his profit margin while the production is reaching a plateau. Added to that is the fact that the fertilizers are heavily subsidized by the government, and we all know full well that the good yields under chemical farming are only the mechanical consequence of the use of pesticides and fertilizers. So then, what will happen in the future if the government stops subsidizing these chemicals? Finally, the cost of using chemicals in agriculture cannot be calculated only in monetary terms, it is now becoming more and more evident that the quality of the water we consume and eventually our very health  have also to pay the toll on the degradation of the environment induced by the use of chemicals. So, all these factors are the reasons why I gave up chemical agriculture and adopted Natural and Organic farming."),s.a.createElement("p",null,"I have seen cases of people growing chemical vegetables and not eating them themselves because they know that these products are not good for their health.

Actually, this kind of farming requires much more labour, so one has to be ready to actually spend more time on the field in order to grow natural products, because Nature has its own pace, its one rhythm. If one wants to get the finest fruits that Nature can provide us with, one has to accept to abide by its laws."),s.a.createElement("p",null,"Also, it is not always easy to market Natural products at a small scale. Let us take the example of millet. It is good for health, gives you a stronger immune system, it is very tasty, its production requires less inputs (water, time, etc), it attracts friendly insects, however, nowadays in Punjab, there is no market for millet. This kind of products would enable people to reduce their reliance on medicines for taking care of their health, but the tradition of consuming millet is nowadays almost completely lost in Punjab."),s.a.createElement("p",null,s.a.createElement("strong",null,s.a.createElement("em",null,"Why is there no massive switch from chemical to natural nowadays in spite of the fact that there is more and more awareness about the ill-effect of chemicals both on Human health and of the Environment?"))),s.a.createElement("p",null,"It is above all a problem of mindset.

Amarjit has travelled far and wide to collect the seeds, which include black corn and ‘rajmah’ varieties from Sikkim. The concept behind the bank was to ensure that farmers could have their own seeds. He had brought a few kilos of Bansi variety of seeds from Maharashtra because of its ability to withstand pests. It is available to farmers at the bank for cultivation in the state. He said the seed bank does not accept money but employs a novel concept. Farmers taking seeds from the bank have to return the original seed quantity as well as 25 per cent extra to ensure that there is enough for subsequent customers.
