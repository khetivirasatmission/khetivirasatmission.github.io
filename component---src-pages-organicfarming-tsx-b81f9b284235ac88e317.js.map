Breaking the avaricious approach in the farming, that came into existence with Green Revolution, was always an uphill battle. Sailing through all odds, preaching techniques was never our goal. We bonded with farmers as a family and worked with them as a companion. We are working on Fukuoka's principle- <i>'The ultimate goal of farming is not the growing of crops, but the cultivation and perfection of human beings.'</i> </p>\n      <p>In order to educate, sensitize and train farmers in organic farming, we organise regular Workshops, Seminars, Public dialogues, Farm visits and  Participatory Resource Appraisals. Our team of experts, from all over the country, is always ready to help and guide our farmers. </p>\n    </Card>\n\n    <Card title=\"Our Initiatives\" bordered={false}>\n      <h4>Training Programmes </h4>\n      <p>\n        KVM organizes regular workshops and trainings. Supported by donation, these trainings are free for farmers.
