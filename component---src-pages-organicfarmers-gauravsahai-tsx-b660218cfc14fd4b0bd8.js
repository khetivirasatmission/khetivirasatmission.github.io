I started farming because is an activity I can connect to: growing my own products, being in harmony with Nature, feeling the soil on my hands, working with my hands. To me, farming is meaningful, it is satisfactory. It is actually a very meditative exercise. It is somehow related to the Zen philosophy the way it is exposed in Fukuoka’s book. I feel that we can achieve peace of mind when farming and that it can help us to live an integrated life. More than a professional choice, for me organic farming represents a lifestyle. If I decide to consume organic, that means that as a consumer I strive to be environment friendly and farmer friendly. I started this project of developing an organic farm with no background, no knowledge, no land… But it was a conscious decision. So then, things fell into place by themselves. A friend of mine offered me to cultivate his land. I met Umendraji and through KVM I was able to start practicing natural farming. Then, I started developing the marketing side by creating the Sattva community; it is basically an attempt to connect consumers and organic farmers."),o.createElement("p",null,o.createElement("strong",null,"Which are the difficulties that you faced in the initial stage and which problem are you still facing now?")),o.createElement("p",null,"The main difficulty that I had to face initially and that I am still facing now to some extent is the lack of availability of sincere farm workers committed to their work. It was actually a big challenge because I was starting farming from scratch. I had to learn what to sow, when to sow, how to sow, how to prepare beds, how to do water channels… In the beginning, I had the impression that I was constrained by indigenous seeds availability, but now, I kind of know where to find them, and we also produce our own seeds on our farm. Another issue was that I was taught to disregard PAU (Punjab Agricultural University) and all that comes from it. So that was, in fact, a mistake especially regarding contextual crop information. Actually, I found out that government institutions are producing a wealth of information. I still have to learn a lot of things regarding farming, but at least, I feel that now I know the basics. Now, I would like to elaborate a little on my understanding of the difference between Organic and Natural farming. Organic farming means the absence of chemicals (urea, DAP, etc) with natural alternative like farm yard manure or substitute like jeevamrita… I think it is different from natural farming in so far as in farming as per Nature’s way, we should minimize the interventions and go along with the climate. And I really think that the fewer the interventions, the better. We should also use open-pollinated seeds. Eventually, natural farming is characterized by the absence of artificial inputs (no vermicompost, no neem, nothing), a perfectly natural field.

When an unfair share of what is grown is destroyed by a bird, an insect or a bacterium, then, it becomes a pest, and a proper and ecological pest management technique is required. Regarding my responsibility towards society, as a farmer, I think that above all it is to supply it with healthy food at a fair price.
