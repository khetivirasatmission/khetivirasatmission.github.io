With her academic background in fashion, she developed a quick passion for natural dyeing. We trained her into using all-natural plant materials to make dyes for the thread, including marigold flowers, carrots, onion skin, babul (gum arabic) bark, pomegranate skin, eucalyptus bark and much more. She attended regular trainings. Thus, not just her skills developed but also her wisdom. She understood that artificial dyes cause skin irritations and infections; thus switching to natural dyes is the need of the hour. TRINJAN has also given this young adult, a source of earning bread and butter, working from home. As people started acknowledging her work through KVM, her confidence is boosted by leaps and bounds. She says, “I will be glad to train others and share this art I have learnt through KVM.

I lament the fact that now we are completely dependent on machines and look down upon blue collared professions. But I had always enjoyed my work.” Being grateful to KVM, she adds, “I am thankful to KVM for acknowledging my hobby and helping me take it to a professional level. Now I am able to provide financial backing to my family, too.” Being more delicate, working with natural material was little challenging in the beginning.

Inheriting the art of spinning from her mother, she used to spin, sometimes as a past-time and sometimes as a stress-relieving exercise. Since 2017, she has started spinning regularly as a professional with KVM. Ramandeep revisits the moments when KVM came to see this young girl spinning, “I felt so happy and honoured that they appreciated my work and gave me an opportunity to hone my skills. I feel contented that the skills learnt playfully from my elders are now my tools for financial stability.” She always experience a mental peace and calm, which comes along, when she spins.

She says, “Working on loom keeps me focused and grounded. It is a perfect exercise to rein in my wandering thoughts.” She is even more satisfied that the work is, now, generating her money. From a pity home maker, her status has now uplifted to a professional artisan. As this art is at the verge of extinction, Punjab is left with very few weavers who still know the intricacies of it.

I work for 8-9 hours per day to make two baskets and a plate in a day.” That's quite a speed! Despite some issues in her back, she manages to give continuous sitting, driven by her determination and passion. Even being a novice, Asha knows that any eatable, if kept in plastic, goes lifeless. Her work has multitude of benefits- from generating livelihood to the reviving of traditional craft and an eco-friendly alternative over plastic.
