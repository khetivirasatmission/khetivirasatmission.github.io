First - The crop pattern\n        was reduced to wheat and rice, that too with heavy doses of chemical\n        applications. Second - Women lost their role and interest in farming\n        practices. Third - Nutritional security was lost, as fruits, vegetables\n        and medicinal plants were either out of the farming scenario or fed with\n        cocktails of pesticides. Fourth - The food was devoid of compassion and\n        life-force energy. To address these issues, we had started working with\n        women to establish kitchen gardens in villages.{\" \"}\n      </p>\n    </Card>\n\n    <Card title=\"Our Project\" bordered={false}>\n      <p>\n        With the support of Association for India's Development (AID), we\n        started the ‘Women Action for Organic Farming and Rural Livelihood’ in\n        2011. Under this umbrella, we are training women to establish Organic\n        Kitchen Gardens (inclusive of vegetables, fruits, medicinal plants and\n        mushroom cultivation) in their backyards. Started from 4 villages in\n        2011, it has now spread across <strong>60 villages</strong> with{\" \"}\n        <strong>6,000 women</strong> involved.{\" \"}\n      </p>\n    </Card>\n\n    <Card title=\"Our Initiatives\" bordered={false}>\n      <h4>Kitchen Gardens</h4>\n      <p>\n        KVM delivers trainings which include designing the garden; making\n        natural growth promotors; pest management; seed conservation & much\n        more. The key feature is that majority of our trainers, project\n        coordinators and trainees are women. The field coordinators pay their\n        regular visits to the gardens every month, addressing the challenges\n        faced by the gardeners.\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            In a season, around 15-20 varieties of vegetables are grown and it\n            reaches up to 50 every year.{\" \"}\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Along with vegetables, fruits and medicinal plants have also been\n            planted.{\" \"}\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            By growing vegetables organically in the households, women have\n            provided nutritional security.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Many health issues and diseases have been reduced after eating\n            chemical-free vegetables.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            On an average, one household is able to save Rs. 1500 per month,\n            which is otherwise spent to buy vegetables.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            People admire the improved taste and quality of the farm-fresh\n            produce.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </p>\n\n      <h4>Seed Banks</h4>\n      <p>\n        A new dimension was added to the project by propagating the concept of\n        indigenous Seed Conservation. Punjab was void of its indigenous seed\n        diversity. Working with women, we realized that they can play a key role\n        to restore the same. So, native seeds, collected from various states and\n        adapted into the environment of Punjab, were distributed to the\n        gardeners. KVM groomed them to conserve these seeds every year for next\n        sowing seasons. Slowly, the gardeners became seed savers; and currently\n        we have <strong>110 family seed banks</strong> maintained by these\n        women. KVM distributes <strong>‘seed kits’</strong> to the newcomers\n        comprising of seeds of 15 - 20 seasonal vegetables.\n      </p>\n\n      <h4>Mushroom Cultivation</h4>\n      <p>\n        To add-on to their livelihood, we organise Mushroom Cultivation\n        workshops for our gardeners.

With the assistance of KVM, some{\" \"}\n        <strong>400 women</strong> are successfully growing and selling organic\n        mushrooms from their homes itself.\n      </p>\n\n      <h4>Young Seed Keepers</h4>\n      <p>\n        This was a group of 20 young girls trained into conservation of\n        indigenous seeds. Their classroom was a one-acre rented plot in Chaina\n        village of Faridkot district. These young seed savers were trained to\n        manage the farm; grow organic and indigenous vegetables; conserve the\n        seeds, preserve them with traditional practices and markete them in\n        various public events, under the auspices of KVM. These seeds were sold\n        as ‘seed kits’ yielding an earning of Rs. 80,000; which was distributed\n        among the group itself.\n      </p>\n    </Card>\n\n    <Card title=\"Garden tales...\" bordered={false}>\n      <StoryList list={artisans} />\n    </Card>\n  </PageLayout>\n);\n","import { Button, Card, Col, Row, Typography } from \"antd\";\nimport React, { useState } from \"react\";\nimport t0 from \"../images/t0.jpg\";\n\ninterface IImageProps {\n  name?: string;\n  image: any;\n}\n\ninterface ILinkedImageProps {\n  name?: string;\n  url?: string;\n  image: any;\n}\n\ninterface IStoryProps {\n  key: string;\n  name?: string;\n  designation?: string;\n  story?: string;\n  region?: string;\n  image: any;\n  file?: string;\n  expanded?: boolean;\n  onClick?: any;\n}\n\nconst storyStyle = {\n  paddingTop: \"4px\",\n};\n\nconst Image = ({ name, image }: IImageProps) => {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"custom-image\">\n      <img alt={name} width=\"100%\" src={image} />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nconst LinkedImage = ({ url, name, image }: ILinkedImageProps) => {\n  return (\n    <a href={url} target=\"_blank\">\n      <Image name={name} image={image} />\n    </a>\n  );\n};\n\nexport const StoryList = ({ list }: any) => {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(list);\n\n  const moveTop = (currentList: any, key: string) => {\n    const temp = [...currentList];\n    const index = temp.findIndex((item: any) => item.key === key);\n    temp.push(...temp.splice(0, index));\n    temp.map(obj => {\n      obj.expanded = false;\n      if (obj.key === key) {\n        obj.expanded = true;\n      }\n    });\n\n    setData(temp);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <Row gutter={18} type=\"flex\">\n      {data.map((item: IStoryProps) => (\n        <Story\n          key={item.key}\n          name={item.name}\n          designation={item.designation}\n          image={item.image}\n          story={item.story}\n          expanded={item.expanded}\n          onClick={() => moveTop(data, item.key)}\n        />\n      ))}\n    </Row>\n  );\n};\n\nconst Story = ({\n  name,\n  designation,\n  story,\n  region,\n  image,\n  file,\n  expanded,\n  onClick,\n}: IStoryProps) => {\n  // const [expanded, setExpanded] = useState(true);\n\n  // const toggle = () => setExpanded(p => !p);\n\n  let im;\n  let f;\n\n  if (image) {\n    im = image;\n  } else {\n    im = t0;\n  }\n\n  if (file) {\n    f = <LinkedImage name={name} image={im} url={file} />;\n  } else {\n    f = <Image name={name} image={im} />;\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Col xs={24} md={12} lg={6}>\n        <Card className=\"card-team\" bordered={false} bodyStyle={{ padding: 0 }}>\n          <div>{f}</div>\n          <div className=\"custom-card\">\n            {name && <h3>{name}</h3>}\n            {designation && <p>{designation}</p>}\n            {region && <h4>{region}</h4>}\n\n            {!expanded && (\n              <Button size=\"small\" onClick={onClick}>\n                Read more...\n              </Button>\n            )}\n          </div>\n        </Card>\n      </Col>\n      {expanded && (\n        <Col xs={24} md={24} lg={18}>\n          {story && (\n            <div style={storyStyle}>\n              <p dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: story }} />\n            </div>\n          )}\n        </Col>\n      )}\n    </>\n  );\n};\n\nStory.defaultProps = {\n  expanded: false,\n};\n\nexport default Story;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
