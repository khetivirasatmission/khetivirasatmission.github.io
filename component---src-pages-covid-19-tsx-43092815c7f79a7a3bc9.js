To revive the great knowledge of textile and handicrafts that women had, TRINJAN started in 4 villages in 2017. The self-reliance of cloth, aka 'Vastra Swavlambham’, which was once a part and parcel of our culture was lost long ago. Most of the spinners and weavers were women. They were also actively involved in agriculture and dairy activities. In the course of industrialization and modernization, most of them lost their patience and interest amid the flood of easily accessible ready-made garments and limited themselves to household chores. The charkhas were abandoned and the weavers were out of practice. KVM identified these women artisans, most of them from poor financial backgrounds, and encouraged them to restart their work professionally, with KVM.
