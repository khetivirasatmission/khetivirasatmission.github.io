Based at Jaitu, district Faridkot, our\n        mission came into existence in late 90s as a thought process and in 2005\n        as a registered charitable trust. To revive the lost glory and serenity\n        of Punjab, we initially focused on the farming community, for it is the\n        backbone of the state. We started ‘Mission Natural Farming’; keeping in\n        mind the need to work on three essentials- Health, Environment and Safe\n        food. But, shortly afterwards, we realized that Punjab is a dying\n        civilization and thus we are facing a ‘Crisis of Civilization’. Thus,\n        expanding our horizons, we adopted a holistic approach inclusive of\n        physical, mental & spiritual health, forests, seed conservation, women\n        empowerment, community culture, livelihood, ecology and resource\n        management.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        We are bridging the gap between various stakeholders- farmers,\n        consumers, experts, academicians, youngsters, women and commoners;\n        providing them with a platform to interact, discuss, guide and serve\n        each other.\n      </p>\n    </Card>\n    <Card title=\"Our Vision\" bordered={false}>\n      <p>\n        We shall co-create and reconnect with the pristine origins of Punjab.\n        Our Land shall, once again, rejoice the prosperity consciousness and the\n        culture of giving amongst naturally thriving sacred forests and\n        indigenous farming practices.\n      </p>\n    </Card>\n\n    <Card title=\"Our Mission\" bordered={false}>\n      <p>\n        We are focused to revive and conserve natural farming practices,\n        traditional and healthy food, organic clothing, traditional handicrafts,\n        vernacular architecture and edible food forests in Punjab. We aim to\n        save the precious seeds of wisdom and knowledge so that we can pass them\n        on to the generations to come.\n      </p>\n    </Card>\n\n    {/* <h2>Core Team</h2>\n    <Row gutter={18}>\n      <Col span={8}>\n        <Card className=\"card-team\" bordered={false} bodyStyle={{ padding: 0 }}>\n          <div className=\"custom-image\">\n            <img alt=\"Shri Umendra Dutt\" width=\"100%\" src={t1} />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"custom-card\">\n            <h3>Shri Umendra Dutt</h3>\n            <p>Executive Director</p>\n          </div>\n        </Card>\n      </Col>\n      <Col span={8}>\n        <Card className=\"card-team\" bordered={false} bodyStyle={{ padding: 0 }}>\n          <div className=\"custom-image\">\n            <img alt=\"Shri Ajay Tripathi\" width=\"100%\" src={t2} />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"custom-card\">\n            <h3>Shri Ajay Tripathi</h3>\n            <p>\n              Director of Marketing, Skill Development & Human Resource\n              Development\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </Card>\n      </Col>\n      <Col span={8}>\n        <Card className=\"card-team\" bordered={false} bodyStyle={{ padding: 0 }}>\n          <div className=\"custom-image\">\n            <img alt=\"Dr Amar Singh Azad\" width=\"100%\" src={t3} />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"custom-card\">\n            <h3>Dr Amar Singh Azad</h3>\n            <p>Director of Environmental Health Action & Research</p>\n          </div>\n        </Card>\n      </Col>\n    </Row> */}\n  </PageLayout>\n);\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
