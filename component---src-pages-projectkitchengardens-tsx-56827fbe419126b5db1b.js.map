First - The crop\n          pattern was reduced to wheat and rice, that too with heavy doses of\n          chemical applications. Second - Women lost their role and interest in\n          farming practices.

Fourth - The food was\n          devoid of compassion and life-force energy.

Under this umbrella, we are training women to establish Organic\n          Kitchen Gardens (inclusive of vegetables, fruits, medicinal plants and\n          mushroom cultivation) in their backyards. Started from 4 villages in\n          2011, it has now spread across <strong>60 villages</strong> with{\" \"}\n          <strong>6,000 women</strong> involved.{\" \"}\n        </p>\n      </Card>\n\n      <Card title=\"Our Initiatives\" bordered={false}>\n        <h4>Kitchen Gardens</h4>\n        <p>\n          KVM delivers trainings which include designing the garden; making\n          natural growth promotors; pest management; seed conservation & much\n          more.

Punjab was void of its indigenous seed\n          diversity. Working with women, we realized that they can play a key\n          role to restore the same. So, native seeds, collected from various\n          states and adapted into the environment of Punjab, were distributed to\n          the gardeners. KVM groomed them to conserve these seeds every year for\n          next sowing seasons. Slowly, the gardeners became seed savers; and\n          currently we have <strong>110 family seed banks</strong> maintained by\n          these women. KVM distributes <strong>‘seed kits’</strong> to the\n          newcomers comprising of seeds of 15 - 20 seasonal vegetables.\n        </p>\n\n        <h4>Mushroom Cultivation</h4>\n        <p>\n          To add-on to their livelihood, we organise Mushroom Cultivation\n          workshops for our gardeners. Seeds and other raw materials are made\n          available, along with. With the assistance of KVM, some{\" \"}\n          <strong>400 women</strong> are successfully growing and selling\n          organic mushrooms from their homes itself.\n        </p>\n\n        <h4>Young Seed Keepers</h4>\n        <p>\n          This was a group of 20 young girls trained into conservation of\n          indigenous seeds. Their classroom was a one-acre rented plot in Chaina\n          village of Faridkot district. These young seed savers were trained to\n          manage the farm; grow organic and indigenous vegetables; conserve the\n          seeds, preserve them with traditional practices and markete them in\n          various public events, under the auspices of KVM.
