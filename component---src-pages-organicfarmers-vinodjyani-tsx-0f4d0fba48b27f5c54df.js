Mostly: leadership without aim. The population is considered as a problem, a burden rather than an asset. After India’s independence, the small units started disappearing. Mahatma Gandhi’s idea was lost. Instead, we saw the rapid growth of big units, big centralized industries. Village people were displaced towards cities’ slums. Because of lack of job in the agriculture sector and no work after the harvest, life in villages underwent many changes. So that is the main drawback: too much centralization has left the local bodies without any power. Instructions are coming from above along with funds, and village people do not have a say in their future or on the projects that need to be supported, and the way the money should be used to create a positive impact on the village’s life. Two examples: village streets using brick lane: the money can only be spent for that purpose; but is that really the priority everywhere? Second example, the school system: in my village there are more classrooms than classes. So, because there is no discretion on the use of funds, the money is misused and does not serve to solve the real issues. The government is not able to guide the population in constructive work: so people tend to become idle. With no plan to provide job to the people, unemployment is become a really big issue in India.

Traditional varieties of wheat contained more than 14% of protein, and HYV less than 6 %. Total soluble sugars (carbohydrate) are also less by 0,5% in HYV. Millet used to be the main diet of rural people but with modernization it disappeared from our diet… Most farmers only cultivate wheat and rice, and the rice is not even for Punjab but for South India. In Punjab, people mainly consume wheat. And nowadays there is lack of diversity in food because of monoculture. To solve this problem, the government should give direct subsidies to the organic farmers and stop importing foreign chemicals like pesticides and fertilizers. A bag of urea is sold for Rs.260 to farmer whereas its actual value on the international market is Rs.850. Similarly, a bag of DAP is sold for Rs.460 to Indian farmers, when it is bought at 2600 (the international price).

The problem is that very often Indians are not duty-conscious and after education they tend to disregard manual/physical work. The corruption is actually already present in their diet. Indeed, we can all see that lots of Indian people are not physically well-built up and present a weak structure both because of a low protein diet and no physical work. The problem in the transmission of the sense of duty is that people are sometime aware, but they are also attracted by money so they don’t do what they know to be right and good. So this is the well-known greed problem that we find all over India and all over the world and that makes it difficult to transmit a sense of responsibility. Another problem is that farmers tend to lose interest in their activity, so when they have enough land they give it on contract for Rs.25 000/acre/year. But to be able to pay the rent, the farmer who is renting needs a bumper yield, and therefore uses more fertilizers and pesticides in spite of his awareness of the negative effects of these chemicals."),o.createElement("p",null,o.createElement("strong",null,"What is your vision of the “ideal farmer” and how far do they think they stand from this ideal?")),o.createElement("p",null,"I try to become an ideal farmer so that others can follow my example.

For the last 30 years, the traditional structure has been breaking down. As a result, women are now out of farming. They have the fundamental role of actually feeding the family. Nowadays, the biodiversity does not exist in Punjab , and has to be recreated artificially, but in the Past, when it was naturally there.
