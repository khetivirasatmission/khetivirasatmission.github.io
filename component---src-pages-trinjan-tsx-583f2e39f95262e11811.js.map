I work for 8-9 hours per day to make two baskets and a plate in a day.” That's quite a speed!

The self-reliance of cloth, aka 'Vastra\n          Swavlambham’, which was once a part and parcel of our culture, was\n          lost long ago. Most of the spinners and weavers were women. They were\n          also actively involved in agriculture and dairy activities. In the\n          course of industrialisation and modernization, most of them lost their\n          patience and interest amid the flood of easily accessible ready-made\n          garments and limited themselves to household chores. The charkhas were\n          abandoned and the weavers were out of practice.

village in Muktsar district. With her\n            academic background in fashion, she developed a quick passion for\n            natural dyeing. We trained her into using all-natural plant\n            materials to make dyes for the thread, including marigold flowers,\n            carrots, onion skin, babul (gum arabic) bark, pomegranate skin,\n            eucalyptus bark and much more. She attended regular trainings. Thus,\n            not just her skills developed but also her wisdom. She understood\n            that artificial dyes cause skin irritations and infections; thus\n            switching to natural dyes is the need of the hour. TRINJAN has also\n            given this young adult, a source of earning bread and butter,\n            working from home. As people started acknowledging her work through\n            KVM, her confidence is boosted by leaps and bounds. She says, “I\n            will be glad to train others and share this art I have learnt\n            through KVM. I will, happily, carry on with this work as it gives me\n            deep creative satisfaction.” Rimpy represents the youth, which if\n            provided with appropriate guidance and skills, can bring a change in\n            the outlook of youngsters.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </Col>\n    </Row>\n\n    <Row gutter={18}>\n      <Col xs={24} md={12} lg={6}>\n        <div id=\"gagandeepkaur\">\n          <Profile\n            name=\"Gagandeep Kaur (26)\"\n            designation=\"Embroider and Tailor\"\n            image={t2}\n          />\n        </div>\n      </Col>\n      <Col xs={24} md={12} lg={18}>\n        <div style={storyStyle}>\n          <p>\n            A high school pass out, Gagandeep Kaur, lives in the Kotli village\n            in district Muktsar.

She says, “I continued\n            both of these skills as a past time ever since I had learnt them. I\n            lament the fact that now we are completely dependent on machines and\n            look down upon blue collared professions.

Now I am able to provide financial backing to my family,\n            too.” Being more delicate, working with natural material was little\n            challenging in the beginning.

Based at Jaitu, Faridkot, this is the source of bread and\n            butter to her family of five. She explains her routine, “I go to\n            different spots near the village pond to collect the raw material. I\n            work for 8-9 hours per day to make two baskets and a plate in a\n            day.” That's quite a speed!

When she does this work,\n            she says it makes her feel good. She will complete a basket in 3-4\n            days, more if there is a lot of housework. To begin, she soaks the\n            grass for one day and then it is ready to be used to make the\n            basket. Manjit does not have free time on her hands.

Mahinder\n            believes that doing work by hand is good and it makes her happy. She\n            can make 200 /- per day by this doing this work. As compared to the\n            past, she does less work now, because she is older. Now she works an\n            hour or two in a day.

She says that because she started doing this so many years\n            ago, everyone knows her as a weaver.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div>\n          <Profile name=\"Gurjit Kaur\" image={t12} />\n          <p>\n            Gurjit Kaur is 40 years old, lives in village Kotli, Muktsar. She\n            says that in the past, everyone did work like weaving but now, no\n            one is interested. But Gurjit believes that doing work by hand is\n            good. She says that now that the machines have come, they have taken\n            away the importance of handwork. She also is able to help pay for\n            her house expenses from the money that she earns from weaving.\n            Weaving also makes her feel like there is more of a purpose in her\n            life because many people in her village know her as a weaver and\n            they like her work. Still, there are times when people do not pay\n            her properly and so she appreciates that KVM gives her work, paying\n            her well and on time. She is part of a family of craftswomen who\n            weave and embroider, and they continue an intergenerational\n            connection to this cultural work while also doing it together.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </Col> */}\n      {/* </Row> */}\n    </PageLayout>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Page;\n\nexport const Head: HeadFC = () => <SEO title=\"Trinjan\" />;\n"],"names":["storyStyle","paddingTop","Image","_ref","name","image","___EmotionJSX","className","alt","width","src","LinkedImage","_ref2","url","href","target","StoryList","_ref3","list","data","setData","useState","gutter","type","map","item","Story","key","designation","story","expanded","onClick","currentList","temp","index","findIndex","push","splice","obj","moveTop","_ref4","im","f","region","file","t0","xs","md","lg","bordered","bodyStyle","padding","size","style","dangerouslySetInnerHTML","__html","defaultProps","props","valueNode","value","formatter","precision","decimalSeparator","_props$groupSeparator","groupSeparator","prefixCls","val","String","cells","match","negative","int","decimal","replace","padEnd","slice","genStatisticStyle","token","_extends2","componentCls","marginXXS","colorTextDescription","statisticTitleFontSize","colorTextHeading","statisticContentFontSize","statisticFontFamily","marginBottom","color","fontSize","fontFamily","display","direction","marginInlineEnd","marginInlineStart","genComponentStyleHook","fontSizeHeading3","statisticToken","WrapperStatistic","valueStyle","_props$value","title","valueRender","prefix","suffix","_props$loading","loading","onMouseEnter","onMouseLeave","_props$decimalSeparat","_useStyle","_useStyle2","wrapSSR","hashId","cls","paragraph","timeUnits","formatCountdown","config","_config$format","format","Date","getTime","current","now","duration","leftDuration","escapeRegex","keepList","str","templateText","replacedText","reduce","unit","includes","Math","floor","RegExp","len","length","toString","padStart","formatTimeStr","max","Countdown","_props$format","onChange","onFinish","forceUpdate","useForceUpdate","countdown","syncTimer","timestamp","setInterval","clearInterval","node","undefined","formatValue","Link","to","float","columns","dataIndex","intervention","artisans","t1","t2","t5","t7","t3","PageLayout","DonateButton","border","height","allow","rowClassName","_","dataSource","pagination","sm","Head","SEO"],"sourceRoot":""}
