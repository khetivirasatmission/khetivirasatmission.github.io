      <p>
        Participatory Guarantee System (PGS) is a quality assurance initiative
        that is locally relevant, emphasize the participation of stakeholders,
        including producers and consumers and operate outside the frame work of
        third party certification. As per IFOAM (2008) definition "Participatory
        Guarantee Systems are locally focused quality assurance systems. They
        certify producers based on active participation of stakeholders and are
        built on a foundation of trust, social networks and knowledge exchange‚Äù.
        PGS is a process in which people in similar situations (in this case
        small holder producers) assess, inspect and verify the production
        practices of each other and take decision on organic certification
        (PGS-Green and PGS Organic ).

      <p>
        In PGS organic farmers have full control over the certification process
        and are able to produce far more credible and effective system of
        quality assurance compared to third party certification. Important
        benefits of this system over third party certification system are as
        follows:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The procedures are simple; documents are basic and use the local
            languageunderstandable to farmers.
          </li>
          <li>
            All the members are local and known to each other. Being themselves
            practicing organic farmers have high degree of understanding on
            day-to-day knowledge or acquaintance of the farm.
          </li>
          <li>
            Peer appraisers are among the group and live in the same village,
            therefore have betteraccess to surveillance{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            Peer appraisal instead of third party inspections reduces cost
          </li>
          <li>
            Mutual recognition and support between Regional PGS groups ensures
            better networking for processing and marketing.
          </li>
          <li>Empowers farmers with increased capacity building</li>
          <li>Bring consumers to the farm without the need of middleman</li>
          <li>
            Unlike grower group certification system, PGS offer every farmer
            with individual certificate and each farmer is free to market its
            own produce independent of group.
          </li>
          <li>
            Consumers and buyers are often involved in production and
            verification process
          </li>
          <li>
            Random residue testing at regular intervals ensures the integrity
            and increases thetrust.
          </li>
