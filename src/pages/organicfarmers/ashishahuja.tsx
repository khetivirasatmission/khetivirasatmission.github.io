        {" "}
        When I came to farming, I always wanted to farm organically. But since I
        was new, and it was easier to do chemical, I decided to start with
        chemical. But the germ was here. When I realized that my father was
        diagnosed with cancer, it increased my determination to start. Earlier,
        I noticed that organic inputs were more expensive. Then, I met Vinod
        Jyani and after that I attended a workshop with Subash Palekar. I felt a
        boost because, he was preaching simple techniques and his enthusiasm got
        transmitted very easily. He made us believe that it could be done
        easily. I seriously started in early 2006. Even though I did not meet
        the success I was expecting, I still consider it sufficiently successful
        not to pull out of it. I know that my unsatisfactory results are due to
        my lack of rigor in applying the techniques the way they were taught. I
        started with 30 acres and now I do 25 acres. For the first 2 years, I
        was following Subash Palekar. Then, I started applying a mix of methods.

      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        Productivity is a problem, because I don’t want to sell it at a premium.
        The quantity of mulching material is not available to practice it
        properly on my fields. And the second problem is weeding. It creates a
        management problem and a problem of monitoring. If, it is done at the
        right time, then it is ok. But because of external issues, I am not
        spending enough time on the farm. This is my biggest problem. Moreover,
        I don’t produce jaggery or organic cow urine. I don’t have purely
        organic diet for my cattle.

      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        My primary responsibility is to provide safe and healthy food to myself
        and my family, and to my people (farm workers). It is also important to
        earn money so that I can live comfortably. The corollary is to sell as
        local as possible and to make my soil as fertile as it is possible in
        this area. The organic content will never reach 3%, as it is advised to
        the organic farmer, because the weather won’t allow it. Right now, it is
        0.3 %. My duty is also simply to be a steward to the land.

        {" "}
        It’s not in farmers’ hands. You can just set an example. I am talking
        about my children. I will try to act nonchalantly; I want to make the
        environment enjoyable. People can come and realize that staying on the
        farm is meaningful. There should be a lot of exchange in knowledge. The
        only thing you can do is set an example. But the people who will be
        inspired are most likely urban people. They are probably also the ones
        who will be most successful because they are more driven. Grass always
        looks greener on the other side.

      <p>
        {" "}
        I think it’s the other way round. I was exposed to different cultures; I
        had access to more knowledge. That’s why I started Natural Farming. “My
        lifestyle influenced by NF”, really speaking, does not apply to me. It
        has been a little failure, you know...

          As a natural farmer, how do you now view Nature, and where do you see

      <p>
        {" "}
        We are part of nature. It is something you have to work with instead of
        fighting with. Trees are for me the purest forms in which Nature can be
        seen; but not any kind of trees, the big trees; something that has been
        given space to grow.

          What is your opinion about the role of women on the farm; in society;

      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        I would like my wife to be involved. I can’t stay on my farm unless my
        family stays with me. Her training and inclination are not really
        related to agriculture. If I was a bachelor, I wouldn’t have realized
        that we have to have women involved, so that you can stay on your farm.
        Even if it is not in farm production, they should be involved in
        something that has some connection with agriculture. But, they have
        maybe a greater role in marketing. Women were never involved in the
        management. I would like to involve my family so that I can get
        meaningful inputs from which we could create things, so that we can do
        value addition (Instead of selling raw cotton, selling processed
        products.)

        <strong>
          How do you deal with the social pressure to adopt consumerist’s
          behaviors (maximizing your leisure time, minimizing you labor time,
          that is to say, spending less time on your work and more time on
          entertainment )?
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s not so true in the Indian context. The pressure here is not to have
        more leisure. My family wants me to dress better. The pressure is to
        conform to social standards. I don’t have unjust requirements. There is
        no real pressure. Especially in a well-educated family, this is very
        easily handled. They understand.

          According to you, what is the main political problem in Punjab at the
          moment?
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p> No one is doing his job sincerely in the government.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        <strong>How does it affect you?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The things that are supposed to reach me by way of the government
        (infrastructure or service at the knowledge level) are not. The effort
        level is inadequate, we find mostly bookish practices. In organic
        farming, they don’t provide much guidance; they teach mostly how to use
        chemical, because there are vested interests. In the procurement
        policies, environmental questions are left out of the equation. The
        system is full of self-contradiction. So, more sincerity is the major
        requirement. I would like the government to be less involved: so much
        food wasted, improper cropping only because of the centralized
        management of the PDS (Public Distribution System).
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          What do you think the government policy should be in Punjab and in
          India regarding agriculture?
        </strong>{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        There should be a policy to promote organic farming, made by successful
        organic farmers.
      </p>
      <p>
        They should set-up government unit to produce bio-predators. What they
        have to do is precisely taking more into account the environment in the
        equation. Just a few ideas: support structure should be broader; more
        work on non-cereal crop; improving varieties for pulses.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        And regarding other problems like poverty, ill-nutrition, inequalities,
        and unemployment?
      </p>
      <p>
        No one is sincere. With so many brilliant people, how come these
        problems are still there? Sincerity and empathy are required.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        <strong>Which techniques do you implement on your farm?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A lot of Palekar’s methods: Mulching, jivamrit, bijamrit, rotation, more
        tree crops, agro-forestry or fruit.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        <strong>Which kind of crop do you grow?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Desi cotton, wheat, pulses: moong, dal, pigeon pea, gram, mustard, rape
        seed, kinnow, cow pea, pear, peaches, juar.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        <strong>Where do you get you seeds from?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some I conserve, like wheat, gram (but I may have to change because I
        don’t have a proper seed storage), cotton, (60% is my own seed) moong,
        some from the seed-shop or from other farmers.
