      <p>
        TRINJAN is the symbol of caring and sharing in Punjabi community. Under
        this umbrella, women used to spin, weave, knit, sing, celebrate,
        appreciate and create different kinds of artistic products. It used to
        be a platform of collective teaching and learning with a close
        association of nature and culture. The type of development model which
        is being adopted in last 5-6 decades didn’t allow women to enhance the
        collective working and its spread to the next generation. Younger
        generation is getting school and college education where these
        traditional creative skills are not considered worthy. That’s why the
        spinning wheel which is a symbol of life is being burnt by people in
        chullah as fuel wood. Same has happened with the handlooms and other
        material used for handicrafts and textile items.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this background and zeal to prevent this great traditional art from
        being vanished, KVM started working for its revival. For us, these are
        not mere products that come out, there is a connect of human and nature
        that can be clearly seen along with the association and owness. In order
        to prevent this heritage, Organic Desi Cotton is being grown by the
        farmers, procured by KVM, hand spun, naturally dyed and hand woven by
        the rural artisans. Along with this there are artisans who do hand
        embroidery, make different grass crafts and other decorative products.
        All these skills have been promoted and developed under TRINJAN.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has freedom for the artisans as they can work from home, most of the
        artisans are women. It’s a very good opportunity for the livelihood
        generation and pass on this skill to the next generation. KVM believes
        that revival of traditional, slow, natural and cultural wisdom shall
        help addressing the physical, mental and emotional health crisis that
        people have been going through.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a people’s initiative where KVM is acting as a platform only. We
        urge you to come forward and support the work in whatever capacity you
        could i.e. financially, providing marketing, documentation of folklore
        associated, reaching out to more people, helping in providing the
        required infrastructure and by visiting any part of this value chain any
        time. It’s a call to all those concerned and worried about the
        contemporary model of development to contribute for the change we all
        wish to have for a better world.

          <p>
            Rimpy Kaur of Kotli village in Muktsar district is 18 years old and
            has a BSCFT. With her background in fashion, it is not surprising
            that Rimpy took to natural dying; and she has developed a quick
            passion for it. She began practicing natural dying only 5-6 months
            ago, learning from a KVM training. She uses all-natural plant
            materials to make her dyes for the thread, including marigold
            flowers, carrots, onion skin, babul tree bark (gum arabic),
            pomegranate skin, and eucalyptus bark and leaves. She explains that
            for barks like the babul or eucalyptus, she will soak the bark for a
            month, then she will bring the water to a boil. After this boiling,
            she strains the bark out and puts the thread into the water. After
            2-3 hours, she brings this to a boil again. Finally, after this, she
            pulls the thread out and rinses it with fresh water. She wanted to
            learn how to do this because she likes the idea of using natural
            dyes. She says it is better for the skin and to reduce skin
            irritations and infections. She also has developed this work into a
            source of income. She wants to continue to do it in her house,
            noting that it benefits her social life as people come to visit her
            and see her work, though her friends cannot believe what she creates
            is done all naturally. She says that now she will happily teach
            anyone who wants to learn how to do this and she will continue on
            with her work, feeling proud that she is becoming known in her
            community for her work in natural dying. It is an example of a
            connection to and revival of traditional practices that can be
            applied to the needs of today’s world and have multiple health,
            social, and economic benefits as well.

            Gagandeep Kaur is 26 years old, has a 10th grade education, and
            lives in the village of Kotli in Muktsar district. She is Mistri
            caste and has 6 members in her family. She has been practicing
            embroidery since she was 15 years old, learning both from school and
            from her mother. She also learned stitching from her sister. She
            says she is always doing at least one of these handcrafts and
            laments that in the past, everyone did work by hand but now everyone
            wants the work done by machines. She says, smiling, that in her
            school, she was really good at embroidery. So much so, that many
            girls wanted her to do their embroidery homework for them. She
            enjoys the work. The work provides a value to her household because
            she brings more income in. She also feels that it is beneficial to
            her social life because many people know her and come to her house
            to visit her and see her embroidery. Gagandeep is quiet and does not
            share much; she comes across as shy. But in her few words, she still
            shows the layers of benefits to doing handcraft work; in this case
            embroidery and stitching. Just in her twenties, she is not only
            adding to her family’s financial well-being but is creating
            beautiful works while reducing her stress and feeling good about her
            place in community.

          <p>
            Aasha Rani is 70 years old and lives in Jaitu, Faridkot. She has no
            formal education, and there are 5 members in her family. She ta ught
            herself how to weave baskets and similar crafts when she was 15
            years old and has been doing it ever since. Since the beginning, she
            has made them mostly to sell. She can usually make 2 bowls or one
            larger plate in a day. She goes to different places near the river
            to collect the raw material of date palm leaves. She works 8-9 hours
            each day making the baskets and other woven crafts. While she often
            has back pain if she is working for a while, if she does, she will
            get up and walk around and it will feel better. It does not deter
            her from the work, though, because doing the work relieves her
            tension. She says that she doesn’t feel the stress of the house when
            she is making baskets. She feels that because of her work, she is
            physically and mentally fit. Aasha also talks about the health
            benefits of using her woven crafts. She says that many people do not
            want to use plastic, they prefer her baskets. If we place chapati in
            this craft, she adds, we reduce diseases [because it’s not putting
            hot food into plastic]. She says that they put fruit in the baskets;
            they put everything in them. It’s very beneficial to the house to
            have them to use. This work shows the diversity of benefits from
            economic, mental health well-being, ecological and general health
            more broadly in the use of the crafts over plastic, and ties to
            cultural tradition.

            M​anjit Kaur is 60 years old from the village of Ramuana in the
            Faridkot district of Punjab. She is a basket and bowl maker as well
            as a kitchen gardener. When she was young, her aunt and grandmother
            taught her how to make the woven baskets from the straw grass;
            everyone would sit together and make them. She says that now people
            don’t sit together anymore. They could but the younger generation
            are not interested in learning the craft. When she does this work,
            she says it makes her feel good. She will complete a basket in 3-4
            days, more if there is a lot of housework. To begin, she soaks the
            grass for one day and then it is ready to be used to make the
            basket. Manjit does not have free time on her hands. There is always
            work to do and she does everything in her house. But she feels that
            it is good for health to have good work. The impacts of both having
            an organic kitchen garden and continuing to incorporate her
            traditional basket weaving into her daily life are clear for Manjit.
            They are holistically beneficial to Manjit herself as well as her
            family and the broader community and planet.

            Ramandeep Kaur is 23 years old and lives in Kotli, Muktsar. She has
            a BCA degree. There are 4 members in her family. Three to four years
            ago she began spinning. She says that, to her, spinning is both a
            hobby and a profession. In her family, in every generation – her
            mother, her grandmother, etc. – each one spun and she learned from
            them. But, she doesn’t have any friends her age who also spin. At
            times when she feels stress, she will spin and feel better.
            Ramandeep talks about KVM coming to meet her to see the young girl
            who was spinning. She was so happy and honored that they came to see
            her and that that they gave her work. Appearing shy and quiet,
            Ramandeep answers questions with short sentences. Yet, she is
            clearly proud of her work and commitment to spinning. She talks
            about the financial benefit of treating this like a career and being
            able to bring extra income in. Additionally, though, even in her
            young twenties, she is aware of how much better, physically and
            mentally, she feels when she spins each day. Furthermore, she is
            able to articulate both the importance of carrying on this family
            and cultural tradition, noticing that her generation – those around
            her – are not necessarily doing the same.

            Sinderpal Kaur is 57 years old and lives in the village of Kotli,
            Muktsar district. Fifty years ago, as a girl, she learned how to
            weave. It took her about a month to learn the basics of the craft
            from her mother and after that, she continued on, becoming more
            skilled at it. She says that when she does this work, she feels
            better and that it is good for her health. She says that it reduces
            her pain. When she sits idly, then she thinks about her worries and
            her stresses. When she is weaving, she doesn’t think about these
            other things but can just focus on the work in front of her.
            Sinderpal also values this work because it supports her financially.
            In her opinion, doing work by hand is good and she prefers this. It
            also has become the way in which she has developed a good reputation
            – in her village, she is known as a weaver. She says that the
            younger generations are not interested in connecting with this
            traditional craft work but she works hard to try to make that
            connection. If the youth are willing to learn, then she will teach
            them.

            Gurcharan Kaur lives in Kotli, Muktsar and is 60 years old. She
            lives alone and has no formal education. When she was 15 years old,
            her older sister taught her how to weave and she has been weaving
            ever since. She now can complete one full piece in about two weeks
            or so, working on them for about 4 hours each day. Gurcharan also
            says that she feels better when she is doing it. When she stops, she
            says that her body also stops and doesn’t feel as well. She
            continues advocating that doing work by hand is best. Indirectly,
            this is what this case study highlights. It is not just about the
            weaving being a source of income and improved economic stability,
            but that the work that is being done by hand is also maintaining a
            simplicity to life that is often overlooked.

            Sukhjit Kaur is 60 years old and lives in Kotli, Muktsar. She has no
            formal education. She began weaving when she was 20 years old,
            learning from her mother, and has been doing it ever since. She says
            that she does it to make things that she needs in her house and that
            it is also a helpful income source – making money by doing weaving
            for other people as well. It takes her about 20 days to make one
            weaving and she feels that it is helpful to her household income and
            that she is satisfied with the money that she makes. She also feels
            that it connects her to her family, from the past and into the
            future. Now, her daughter-in-law has shown interest in learning to
            weave. Additionally, she says, that it connects her to her culture.
            In the past, she says, everyone did work by hand but now no one
            wants to do this work. She thinks that if we want to connect the
            younger generation to it, we need to be doing it and teaching them
            while we are doing it. This case shows the passion that can be
            evoked when someone not only conscientiously benefits from their
            work (i.e. economically) but enjoys it in a way that they look
            forward to time spent in the process itself.

            doing it ever since. She says that in the past, everyone did work
            like this and that if younger generations are going to continue, the
            work needs to be done in front of them, so they can see it. Mahinder
            believes that doing work by hand is good and it makes her happy. She
            can make 200 /- per day by this doing this work. As compared to the
            past, she does less work now, because she is older. Now she works an
            hour or two in a day. But it continues to keep her connected to her
            culture and because of it, her community sees her in a positive
            light. She says that because she started doing this so many years
            ago, everyone knows her as a weaver.

            says that in the past, everyone did work like weaving but now, no
            one is interested. But Gurjit believes that doing work by hand is
            good. She says that now that the machines have come, they have taken
            away the importance of handwork. She also is able to help pay for
            her house expenses from the money that she earns from weaving.
            Weaving also makes her feel like there is more of a purpose in her
            life because many people in her village know her as a weaver and
            they like her work. Still, there are times when people do not pay
            her properly and so she appreciates that KVM gives her work, paying
            her well and on time. She is part of a family of craftswomen who
            weave and embroider, and they continue an intergenerational
            connection to this cultural work while also doing it together.{" "}
